# Results

On the Jackson-Fischer dataset, SPADE achieved a mean performance of 0.720 ± 0.061, significantly outperforming all 18 baseline methods evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation. The best-performing baseline method was Cell Type Composition with GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis using sum aggregation, which achieved 0.617 ± 0.092. SPADE demonstrated a substantial improvement of 0.102, representing a 16.5% relative improvement over this best baseline method, with statistical significance confirmed through a paired t-test (t = 2.94, p = 0.017). The performance range across the 10 folds was 0.582 to 0.783, demonstrating consistent performance across different data splits.

On the METABRIC dataset, SPADE achieved a mean performance of 0.688 ± 0.038, again significantly outperforming all baseline methods. The best-performing baseline method was Cell Type Composition with GradientBoostingSurvivalAnalysis using sum aggregation, which achieved 0.570 ± 0.071. SPADE demonstrated an even larger improvement of 0.118, representing a 20.7% relative improvement over this best baseline method, with highly significant statistical evidence (t = 4.06, p = 0.003). The performance range across the 10 folds was 0.625 to 0.737, showing consistent and robust performance. The lower standard deviation of SPADE's performance compared to baseline methods indicates more stable and reliable predictive capability across both datasets.
